#About the ABC Computer
The Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC) was the first electronic digital computer. Not long after it was built by its inventors, professor John Vincent Atanasoff and assistant Clifford E. Berry, it fell into obscurity, and was left in a basement at Iowa State University (ISU), where it was eventually dismantled. In a patent lawsuit it was revealed that the ABC was in fact an earlier machine than the ENIAC, built by John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert, who in fact had visited and corresponded with Atanasoff.

#About this Resource
So far there is only one replica of the first electronic digital computer. It was built in 1997 by a team at Iowa State University, where it was first invented, and has been on loan to the Computer History Museum since May 2012. Here for the first time in August 2016, the plans of the computer are available for anyone to download. The hope is that people can use the resources here to discuss and gain an understanding of an important part of computer history, and for people to collaborate on creating new replicas and other projects. Anyone may collaborate in editing and adding to these resources.

##The only existing replica:

#Possible Next Steps:
1. Digitize electronic drawings.
2. Convert 2D drawings into a 3D model.
3.  Start creating replicas. Ideas include miniature replicas and full scale replicas.

####The beginning of a miniature replica, 1/3x, a frame with 1/2 inch angle iron:

#Goals and Progress:
This is for others to set and document.


So far, the plans have been released.
